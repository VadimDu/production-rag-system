    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval systems with generative (LLM) models.
    RAG systems first retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base using semantic similarity search based on vector embeddings, then generate responses.
    This approach helps reduce hallucinations and provides more accurate, relevant and up to date factual responses.
    Vector databases (such as ChromaDB or FAISS) are commonly used in RAG systems for efficient document retrieval.
